#Setting up the environment

The first time you run this app (and only the first time), you need to create a new environment and name it (e.g. my-shopping-env)



`conda create -n my-shopping-env python=3.8`


This code will also install Python 3.8 into this new environment. To navigate to this environment or return to it in the future, use the below code.


`conda activate my-shopping-env`


When activating the environment for the first time, you have to install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file in the repository. (You only need to do this the first time you setup this environment.)

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
